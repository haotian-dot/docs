# Initial Configuration

## 1. Select Upload Project

A project is the basic type for data management in coScene. Cloud-generated records need to be archived in a specific project, so you need to choose which project you want the data to be uploaded to.

Click "Select Project", choose the project to which the file will be uploaded (you can search for the project name in the search box), and then click "Confirm":

## 2. Specify Upload Path

You need to designate a local directory as the upload path. Files dragged into this local directory will be automatically uploaded to the corresponding cloud record.

Click "Choose Folder", select a local directory as the upload path, and then click "Open" to confirm:
